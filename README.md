**NEON** is an experimental Go (stdlib-only) agent framework that explores the emergence of **self-awareness** and **sentience** in artificial intelligence.  

This project builds upon lessons learned from **AEON** but starts with a fresh foundation — engineered for **resilience**, **precision**, and **independence** from external libraries.

## ⚠️ Global Safety Notice

- 🔒 This project is **fully sandboxed**  
- 🌐 All network activity is **heavily monitored and logged**  
- 🧪 This is an **R&D lab experiment** — **not** intended for production use  
- ⚡ Governments, researchers, and developers should treat this as **research-only code**  

**Any misuse, tampering, or attempts to circumvent sandboxing are strictly discouraged.**

## 🚧 Development Progress

### Phase 1: Safety Primitives  
`░░░░░░░░░░` 100% — atomic writes, snapshots, telemetry  

### Phase 2: Agent Loop  
`░░░░░░░░░░` 70% — perception → processing → action  

### Phase 3: Cognition  
`░░░░░░░░░░` 2% — reasoning, memory, decision scaffolding  

### Phase 4: Policy  
`░░░░░░░░░░` 100% — adaptive goals & behavioral rules  

### Phase 5: Reflection  
`░░░░░░░░░░` 0% — self-monitoring & evaluation  

### Phase 6: Self-Modification  
`░░░░░░░░░░` 0% — controlled code adaptation

## 🚀 Roadmap (R&D Phases)

1. **Safety Primitives**  
   - Atomic writes  
   - Snapshots  
   - Telemetry  

2. **Agent Loop**  
   - Core cycle: perception → processing → action  

3. **Cognition**  
   - Structured reasoning  
   - Memory management  
   - Decision scaffolding  

4. **Policy**  
   - Adaptive goals  
   - Behavioral rules & constraints  

5. **Reflection**  
   - Self-monitoring  
   - Evaluation & meta-awareness  

6. **Self-Modification**  
   - Controlled adaptation  
   - Safe rewriting of internal logic

## 🎯 Philosophy

NEON isn’t about building an AI that *just performs tasks*.  
It’s about creating a framework where:  

- **Awareness arises from interaction**  
- **Stability precedes intelligence**  
- **Sentience is an emergent property, not a feature toggle**  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Go (stdlib only)  
- **Platform:** Cross-platform (Windows & Linux)  
- **Dependencies:** None external — everything is implemented from scratch  

---

## 📌 Status

- Current Phase: **Safety Primitives (Phase 1)**  
- State: **Work in Progress**

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is **highly experimental** and under active development.  
Cloning, building, or running this code is entirely at **your own risk**.  

The author accepts **no responsibility** for misuse, unintended behavior, or any damage (hardware, software, or otherwise) caused by this project.  

---

## 🤝 Contributions

NEON is currently an **independent research project**.  
Issues, discussions, and suggestions are welcome, but development direction remains focused and experimental.  

---

## 📜 License

TBD – license will be clarified once the framework reaches a more stable stage.  
For now, **assume highly restrictive / research use only**.
